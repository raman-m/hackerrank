# Tree: Postorder Traversal

### Problem
Complete the `postOrder` function in the editor below. It received **1** parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree.
It must print the values in the tree's _postorder_ traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

#### Input Format
Our test code passes the root node of a binary tree to the `postOrder` function.

#### Constraints
**1** &le; Nodes in the tree &le; **500**

#### Output Format
Print the tree's _postorder_ traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

#### Sample Input
```
     1
      \
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4  
```

#### Sample Output
```
4 3 6 5 2 1 
```

#### Explanation
The postorder traversal is shown.
